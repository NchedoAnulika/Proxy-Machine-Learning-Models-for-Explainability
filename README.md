# Proxy-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Explainability
In an effort to improve explainability in machine learning, this project explores the use of proxy models as interpretable stand-ins for their black-box equivalents. 
```python
df_cdat = df_cat.drop(['surname', 'firstname', 'middlename', 'date_of_birth'], axis=1)
```
